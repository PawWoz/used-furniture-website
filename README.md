## Introduction

The "Used Furniture" static website was created as part of the course *Basics of Internet Technologies*. Its main goal is to promote and sell used furniture that has been carefully renovated to restore its original beauty and functionality. The project aims to gain practical skills in designing, building, and managing websites.

The target audience includes people looking to furnish their homes economically and lovers of vintage furniture. The site not only showcases unique, restored pieces but also creates an inspiring environment for fans of unique design. It serves as a virtual space that combines aesthetic presentation with an interactive community for renovation and interior design enthusiasts.

The future vision is for the platform to become a go-to place for vintage style lovers, offering inspiration and access to unique furniture with history. As interest grows, "Used Furniture" has the potential to become a central hub, providing unique items and a space for exchanging experiences and ideas.
